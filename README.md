This is the source code associated the manuscript "Nonlinear Multi-Objective Flux Balance Analysis of the Warburg Effect", which is authored by Yi Zhang and Dr. Daniel Boley.
The code can generate Fig. 4 (i.e. base case) in the paper. Simple modification can be made to render the code applicable to other cases in the paper.
If you have any confusion about the code, please reach out to me by emailing zhan2854@umn.edu
